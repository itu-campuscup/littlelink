# LittleLink

Small changes have been made to the original LittleLink project and also on how it was expected to be used.

## Changes

- Relative links for social media buttons are used in `index.html`
- Folders for each social media button have been added with its own `index.html` file.
  This allows the use of URL custom redirects, for example through a service like [rdr.lucashanson.dk](https://rdr.lucashanson.dk), to easily share links to your social media profiles.
  - `/gh` folder for GitHub
  - `/ig` folder for Instagram
  - `/yt` folder for YouTube
  - `/littlelink` folder for the GitHub repository of this project
- Remove unused files
